# odin-landing-page

This is an Odin Project project. I will create a landing page based on a design provided by The Odin Project.
This project will highlite my skills in implementing all the knowledge about HTML & CSS that i learned in the "foundation" path. It includes basic HTML webpage structure, CSS selectors, box model and flexbox.

I wishh myself good luck and lot's of fun while working on it :)
